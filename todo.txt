    (a) Level: 3 - 9
               7 levels
               levels:    random + regular
                       or regular + random
    (b) Training: relevant figure 
    (c) Encoding: option 1: select the encoding by participants
                            3 programs to query one db
                  option 2: random (what I am doing now)
    Time: t seconds
    (d) Practice:
               t seconds
                    color and texture: hit rate 0.5
                    splitvectors:
                           increase time (?)
                           decrease the threshold 0.3 (?)
        Real game:
               t seconds
(5) 3 games (with 3 encodings)

(7) Summary at the end
(8) Lab-based study (eye tracking): this week
    Limited time: 
    Data:
         Data selection: design (the document)
         Prepare data: the original rules for Task 1 and 2
           Task 1: max
           Task 2: min  
           Task 3: X (what is the X?) (can use gist data or new) 
         Random + Regular 
         Rotate data? Sync with eye tracking?
         Ask 4th floor eye tracking

         Wesley's graph study can sync
