                <p class="c1"><span class="c4">Purpose:</span></p>
                <br>
                <p class="c1"></span><span class="c0">The purpose of this study is to compare, understand, or enhance interactive visualization methods to improve human ability to use interactive user interface for knowledge discovery.  You are being asked to volunteer because you may help understand how we see and interact with computers. Your involvement in this study will begin when you agree to participate and will continue until the end of the study in about an hour.</span></p>
                <br>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c4">Procedures/Tasks:</span></p>
                <br>
                <p class="c1"></span><span class="c0">As a participant in this study, you will be asked to perform a set of visualization tasks using several interfaces and visualization methods on a computer screen. These tasks consist of viewing several interactive display methods for human perception and cognition analysis.</span></p>
                <br>
                <p class="c1"></span><span class="c0">You will be asked to fill out a pre-questionnaire to check if you have a normal visual ability. You will read a set of instructions related to this experiment. You will be asked take a short practice test in order to ensure you understand the instructions before taking real task. You understand if you failed in practice test for more than three times, you will not be paid with financial compensation for you time and will be blocked from the system.  Your participation in this study will last for about 0.5 hours in a single visit.</span></p>
                <br>
                <p class="c1"></span><span class="c0">Your role to the tests is that of evaluator of the software. You will not be evaluated in any way; but be helping evaluate the visualization system. All information that obtained from you will remain anonymous. The time it takes me to do each task and other aspects of your interaction with the system will be measured. You can ask questions during the training in order to clarify your understanding of the experiment. During the formal study, you will not allowed to ask any questions.</span></p>
                <br>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c4">Duration:</span></p>
